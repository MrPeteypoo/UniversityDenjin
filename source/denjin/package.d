/**
    Welcome to Denjin, a 3D game engine written in D. The engine is currently under heavy development and is not very 
    flexible with its feature set. The engine is split into sub-packages which can all be used independently of the 
    engine. The primary sub-package currently being developed is denjin.rendering.
